# ranges

To use this code, save it to a file with a .js extension (e.g., ranges.js). Make the file executable by running `chmod +x ranges.js` in the terminal. Then, you can run the CLI application by executing `./ranges.js` in the terminal. The program will prompt you for input and display the resulting ranges based on your input.
